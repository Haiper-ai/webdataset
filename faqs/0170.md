Q: How do I use glob patterns with WebDataset to read data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS)?

A: WebDataset does not natively support glob patterns due to the lack of a consistent API for globbing across different object stores. To use glob patterns with files stored in GCS, you need to manually resolve the glob pattern using `gsutil` and then pass the list of shards to WebDataset. Here's an example of how to do this in Python:

```Python
import os
import webdataset as wds

# Use gsutil to resolve the glob pattern and get the list of shard URLs
shard_list = [shard.strip() for shard in os.popen("gsutil ls gs://BUCKET/PATH/training_*.tar").readlines()]

# Create the WebDataset with the resolved list of shard URLs
train_data = wds.WebDataset(shard_list, shardshuffle=True, repeat=True)
```

This approach ensures that you get the expected behavior when reading data from shards that match a glob pattern in GCS. Remember to install `gsutil` and authenticate with GCS before running the code.
