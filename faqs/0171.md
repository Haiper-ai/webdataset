Q: I'm getting an ImportError when trying to import `PytorchShardList` from `webdataset`. What should I do?

A: The `PytorchShardList` class has been removed in recent versions of the `webdataset` package. If you are using version 0.1 of `webdataset`, `PytorchShardList` was available, but in later versions, it has likely been replaced with `SimpleShardList`. To resolve the ImportError, you should update your import statement to use the new class name. Here's how you can import `SimpleShardList`:

```python
from webdataset import SimpleShardList
```

If `SimpleShardList` does not meet your requirements, you may need to check the documentation for the version of `webdataset` you are using to find the appropriate replacement or consider downgrading to the version that contains `PytorchShardList`.
