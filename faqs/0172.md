Q: Why does the `detshuffle` epoch count not increment across epochs when using WebDataset?

A: The issue with `detshuffle` not incrementing the epoch count across epochs is likely due to the interaction between the DataLoader's worker process management and the internal state of the `detshuffle`. When `persistent_workers=False`, the DataLoader creates new worker processes each epoch, which do not retain the state of the `detshuffle` instance. This results in the `detshuffle` epoch count resetting each time. To maintain the state across epochs, you can set `persistent_workers=True` in the DataLoader. Alternatively, you can manage the epoch count externally and pass it to `detshuffle` if needed. Here's a short example of how to set `persistent_workers`:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Assuming 'dataset' is your WebDataset instance
loader = DataLoader(dataset, persistent_workers=True)
```

If you need to manage the epoch count externally, you could use an environment variable or another mechanism to pass the epoch count to `detshuffle`. However, this approach is less clean and should be used with caution, as it may introduce complexity and potential bugs into your code.
