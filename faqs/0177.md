Q: How can I resume training from a specific step without iterating over unused data when using WebDataset?

A: When using WebDataset for training with large datasets, it's common to want to resume training from a specific step without loading all the previous data into memory. WebDataset provides a feature for this scenario through shard resampling. By setting `resampled=True` or using the `wds.resampled` pipeline stage, you can ensure that you get the same training statistics when restarting your job without the need to skip samples manually. This approach is recommended over trying to implement "each sample exactly once per epoch," which can be complex and environment-dependent.

Here's a short example of how you might use the `resampled` option:

```python
from webdataset import WebDataset

dataset = WebDataset(urls).resampled(rng=my_random_state)
```

And here's how you might use the `wds.resampled` pipeline stage:

```python
import webdataset as wds

dataset = wds.WebDataset(urls).pipe(wds.resampled)
```
