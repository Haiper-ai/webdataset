Q: How can I include the original file name in the metadata dictionary when iterating through a WebDataset?

A: When working with WebDataset, you can include the original file name in the metadata dictionary by defining a function that extracts the `__key__` from the sample and adds it to the metadata. You then apply this function using the `.map()` method in your pipeline. Here's a short example of how to define and use such a function:

```python
def add_filename_to_metadata(sample):
    sample["metadata"]["filename"] = sample["__key__"]
    return sample

# Add this to your pipeline after renaming the keys
pipeline.append(wds.map(add_filename_to_metadata))
```

This function should be added to the pipeline after the renaming step to ensure that the `metadata` key is already present in the sample dictionary.
