Q: How can I speed up subsampling from a tar file when using WebDataset?

A: When working with WebDataset, it's important to remember that it is optimized for streaming data and does not support efficient random access within tar files. To speed up subsampling, you should avoid using very small probabilities with `rsample` as it requires reading the entire stream. Instead, consider using more shards and applying `rsample` to the shards rather than individual samples. This approach avoids the overhead of sequential reading. Additionally, some storage servers like AIStore can perform server-side sampling, which can be more efficient as they can use random access.

```python
# Example of using rsample with shards
dataset = WebDataset("dataset-{0000..9999}.tar").rsample(0.1)
```
