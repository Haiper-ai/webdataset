Q: How can I ensure each batch contains only one description per image when using webdatasets?

A: To ensure that each batch contains only one description per image in webdatasets, you can create a custom transformation function that acts as a filter or collate function. This function can be composed with your dataset to enforce the batching rule. You can use buffers or other conditional logic within your transformation to manage the batching process. Here's a simple example of how you might start implementing such a transformation:

```Python
def unique_image_collate(src):
    buffer = {}
    for sample in src:
        image_id = sample['image_id']
        if image_id not in buffer:
            buffer[image_id] = sample
            if len(buffer) == batch_size:
                yield list(buffer.values())
                buffer.clear()
        # Additional logic to handle leftovers, etc.
    if buffer:
        yield list(buffer.values())

dataset = dataset.compose(unique_image_collate)
```

This function collects samples in a buffer until it has a batch's worth of unique images, then yields that batch and clears the buffer for the next batch. You'll need to add additional logic to handle cases such as the end of an epoch where the buffer may not be full.
