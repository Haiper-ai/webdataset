Q: How does the `default_collation_fn` work in WebDataset when it seems to expect a list or tuple, but the documentation suggests it should handle a collection of samples as dictionaries?

A: The confusion arises from the mismatch between the documentation and the actual implementation of `default_collation_fn`. The function is designed to take a batch of samples and collate them into a single batch for processing. However, the current implementation of `default_collation_fn` in WebDataset does not handle dictionaries directly. Instead, it expects each sample in the batch to be a list or tuple. If you have a batch of dictionaries, you would need to convert them into a list or tuple format before using `default_collation_fn`. Alternatively, you can use `torch.utils.data.default_collate` from PyTorch 1.11 or later, which can handle dictionaries, or you can provide a custom collate function that handles dictionaries. Here's an example of a custom collate function that could handle a list of dictionaries:

```python
def custom_collate_fn(batch):
    # Assuming each element in batch is a dictionary
    collated_batch = {}
    for key in batch[0].keys():
        collated_batch[key] = [d[key] for d in batch]
    return collated_batch
```

You can then pass this `custom_collate_fn` to your data loader.
