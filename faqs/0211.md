Q: How can I write to a remote location using ShardWriter?

A: ShardWriter is designed to write to local disk for simplicity and reliability, but it provides a hook for uploading data to a remote location. You can define a function that handles the upload process and then pass this function to the `post` parameter of ShardWriter. Here's a short example of how to use this feature:

```Python
def upload_shard(fname):
    os.system(f"gsutil cp {fname} gs://mybucket")
    os.unlink(fname)

with ShardWriter(..., post=upload_shard) as writer:
    # Your code to add data to the writer
    ...
```

This approach allows you to have control over the upload process and handle any errors that may occur during the transfer to the remote storage.
