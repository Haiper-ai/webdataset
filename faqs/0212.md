Q: Does WebDataset download all shards at once, and how does caching affect the download behavior?

A: WebDataset accesses shards individually and handles data in a streaming fashion by default, meaning that shards are not cached locally unless caching is explicitly enabled. When caching is enabled, each shard is downloaded completely before being used, which can block training until the download is finished. This behavior contrasts with the streaming mode, where training can start as soon as the first batch is ready. The caching mechanism does not currently download shards in parallel with training, which can lead to delays when starting the training process. To change the local cache name when using `pipe:s3`, you can override the `url_to_name` argument to map shard names to cache file names as desired.

Here's an example of how to override the `url_to_name` function:

```python
import webdataset as wds

def custom_url_to_name(url):
    # Custom logic to convert URL to a cache filename
    return url.replace("http://url/dataset-", "").replace(".tar", ".cache")

dataset = wds.WebDataset("pipe:s3 http://url/dataset-{001..099}.tar", url_to_name=custom_url_to_name)
```
