Q: Can I use `ShardWriter` to write directly to a cloud storage URL like Google Cloud Storage?

A: The `ShardWriter` from the `webdataset` library is primarily designed to write shards to a local disk, and then these shards can be copied to cloud storage. Writing directly to cloud storage is not the default behavior because it can be less efficient and more error-prone due to network issues. However, if you have a large dataset that cannot be stored locally, you can modify the `ShardWriter` code to write directly to a cloud URL by changing the line where the `TarWriter` is instantiated. Here's a short example of the modification:

```python
# Original line in ShardWriter
self.tarstream = TarWriter(open(self.fname, "wb"), **self.kw)

# Modified line to write directly to a cloud URL
self.tarstream = TarWriter(self.fname, **self.kw)
```

Please note that this is a workaround and may not be officially supported. It's recommended to test thoroughly to ensure data integrity and handle any potential exceptions related to network issues.
