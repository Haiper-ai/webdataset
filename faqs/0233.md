Q: How do I ensure that WebDataset correctly splits shards across multiple nodes and workers?

A: When using WebDataset for distributed training across multiple nodes and workers, it's important to use the `split_by_node` and `split_by_worker` functions to ensure that each node and worker processes a unique subset of the data. The `detshuffle` function can be used for deterministic shuffling of shards before splitting. Here's a minimal example of how to set up the dataset pipeline for multi-node training:

```python
import webdataset as wds

dataset = wds.DataPipeline(
    wds.SimpleShardList("source-{000000..000999}.tar"),
    wds.detshuffle(),
    wds.split_by_node,
    wds.split_by_worker,
)

for idx, item in enumerate(iter(dataset)):
    if idx < 2:  # Just for demonstration
        print(f"item: {item}")
```

Make sure you are using a recent version of WebDataset that supports these features. If you encounter any issues, check the version and consider updating to the latest release.
