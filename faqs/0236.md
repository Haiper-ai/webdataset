Q: How does webdataset handle the conversion of tensors to different file formats like .jpg and .npy?

A: In webdataset, the conversion of tensors to specific file formats is determined by the file extension you specify in the key when writing the data using `ShardWriter`. There is no automatic conversion; the tensor is simply saved in the format corresponding to the extension you provide. When reading the data, you can decode the files into tensors using the appropriate arguments. Here's a short example of how to write a tensor as different file formats:

```python
from webdataset import ShardWriter

writer = ShardWriter(...)

sample = {}
sample["__key__"] = "dataset/sample00003"
sample["image.jpg"] = some_tensor  # Will be saved as a JPEG file
sample["image.npy"] = some_tensor  # Will be saved as a NPY file

writer.write(sample)
```

When you write a sample with `{"__key__": "xyz", "image.jpg": some_tensor}`, a JPEG file named `xyz.image.jpg` is created. Conversely, if you write `{"__key__": "xyz", "image.npy": some_tensor}`, an NPY file named `xyz.image.npy` is created.
