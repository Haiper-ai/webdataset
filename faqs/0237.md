Q: How does WebDataset handle filenames with multiple periods when extracting keys?

A: WebDataset uses periods to separate the base filename from the extension, which can lead to unexpected keys when multiple periods are present in the base filename. This is by design to support filenames with multiple extensions, such as `.seg.jpg`. It's important to follow this convention when creating datasets to avoid issues in downstream processing. If you have filenames with multiple periods, consider renaming them before creating the dataset. For matching files, you can use glob patterns like `*.mp3` to ensure you're working with the correct file type.

```python
# Example of using a glob pattern to match files with the .mp3 extension
dataset = wds.Dataset("dataset.tar").select(lambda x: fnmatch.fnmatch(x, "*.mp3"))
```
