Q: Can I filter a WebDataset to select only a subset of categories?

A: Yes, you can filter a WebDataset to select only a subset of categories by using a map function. This is efficient as long as the subset is not too small; otherwise, it can lead to inefficient I/O due to random disk accesses. For very small subsets, it's recommended to create a new WebDataset. Here's a simple example of how to filter categories:

```python
def select(sample):
    if sample["cls"] in [0, 3, 9]:  # Replace with desired categories
        return sample
    else:
        return None

dataset = wds.WebDataset(...).decode().map(select)
```

This approach works well when the number of classes is much larger than the number of shards, and you're not discarding a significant portion of the data. If you find yourself discarding a large percentage of the data, consider creating a new WebDataset for efficiency.
