Q: How can I combine multiple data sources with a specified frequency for sampling from each?

A: To combine multiple data sources with non-integer sampling frequencies, you can use the `RandomMix` function from the WebDataset library. This function allows you to specify the relative sampling weights as floating-point numbers, which can represent the desired sampling frequency from each dataset. Here's an example of how to use `RandomMix` to combine two datasets with a specified sampling frequency:

```python
from webdataset import WebDataset, RandomMix

ds1 = WebDataset('path_to_shards_A/{00..99}.tar')
ds2 = WebDataset('path_to_shards_B/{00..99}.tar')
mix = RandomMix([ds1, ds2], [1.45, 1.0])  # Sampling from ds1 1.45 times more frequently than ds2
```

This will create a mixed dataset where samples from `ds1` are drawn approximately 1.45 times more often than samples from `ds2`.
