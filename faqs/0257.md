Q: How can I efficiently load only the necessary auxiliary images for a sample in my training configuration to save on I/O and decoding time?

A: When working with datasets that include a main image and multiple auxiliary images, you can optimize the data loading process by selectively reading only the required files. This can be achieved by using the `select_files` option in WebDataset or similar tools, which allows you to specify which files to extract from the dataset. By pre-selecting the files during the dataset preparation phase, you ensure that your tar files contain exactly the files needed for training, minimizing unnecessary I/O operations and decoding time for unused images. Here's a short example of how you might use `select_files`:

```python
import webdataset as wds

# Define your selection criteria based on the training configuration
def select_files(sample):
    return [sample['main.jpg']] + [sample[f'aux{i}.jpg'] for i in range(number_of_aux_images)]

# Create a dataset and apply the selection
dataset = wds.WebDataset("dataset.tar").select(select_files)
```

This approach is more efficient than reading all files and discarding the unneeded ones, as it avoids the overhead of reading and decoding data that will not be used in the training process.
