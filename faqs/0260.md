Q: What is the purpose of the `.with_epoch()` method in WebDataset and could it be named more descriptively?

A: The `.with_epoch()` method in WebDataset is used to explicitly set the number of samples that constitute an epoch during distributed training. This is important for ensuring that each worker in a distributed system processes a full epoch's worth of data. The name `.with_epoch()` might not be immediately clear, but it is intended to indicate that the dataset is being configured with a specific epoch length. A more descriptive name like `.set_epoch_size()` could potentially convey the purpose more clearly. However, changing the method name would be a breaking change for existing codebases. Improving the documentation with examples can help clarify the usage:

```python
# Original method name
dataset = dataset.with_epoch(10000)

# Hypothetical more descriptive method name
dataset = dataset.set_epoch_size(10000)
```

In the meantime, users should refer to the improved documentation for guidance on how to use the `.with_epoch()` method effectively.
