Q: How can I include the file name (only the stem, not the extension) in the `metadata` dictionary when using WebDataset?

A: When working with WebDataset, each sample in the dataset contains a special key `__key__` that holds the file name without the extension. To include the file name in the `metadata` dictionary, you can create a custom mapping function that extracts the `__key__` and adds it to the `metadata`. Here's a short code example on how to modify the pipeline to include the file name in the `metadata`:

```python
def add_filename_to_metadata(sample):
    sample["metadata"]["filename"] = sample["__key__"]
    return sample

pipeline = [
    # ... (other pipeline steps)
    wds.map(add_filename_to_metadata),
    # ... (remaining pipeline steps)
]
```

This function should be added to the pipeline after the `wds.decode` step and before the `wds.to_tuple` step. This way, the `metadata` dictionary will contain the file name for each sample processed by the pipeline.
