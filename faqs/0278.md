Q: Why is `with_epoch(N)` needed for multinode training with WebDataset?

A: When using WebDataset for training models in PyTorch, the `with_epoch(N)` function is used to define the end of an epoch when working with an infinite stream of samples. This is particularly important in distributed training scenarios to ensure that all nodes process the same number of batches per epoch, which helps in synchronizing the training process across nodes. Without `with_epoch(N)`, the training loop would not have a clear indication of when an epoch ends, potentially leading to inconsistent training states among different nodes. WebDataset operates with the `IterableDataset` interface, which does not support the `set_epoch` method used by `DistributedSampler` in PyTorch's `DataLoader`. Therefore, `with_epoch(N)` serves as a mechanism to delineate epochs in the absence of `set_epoch`.

```python
# Example of using with_epoch in a training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for sample in webdataset_reader.with_epoch(epoch_length):
        train(sample)
```
