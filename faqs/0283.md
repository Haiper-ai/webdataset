Q: How can I authenticate to read objects from a private bucket with WebDataset?

A: To authenticate and read objects from a private bucket using WebDataset, you need to provide the necessary credentials to the underlying command line programs that WebDataset uses for data access. If you are using a storage provider like NetApp, which is not directly supported by WebDataset's built-in protocols, you can use the `pipe:` protocol to specify a custom command that includes the necessary authentication steps. For example, you can create a shell script that uses your storage provider's CLI tools to authenticate with your `access key id` and `secret access key`, and then pass this script to WebDataset:

```bash
# auth_script.sh
# This script authenticates and downloads a shard from a private bucket
# Replace <ACCESS_KEY>, <SECRET_KEY>, <BUCKET_NAME>, and <SHARD_NAME> with your actual values
netappcli --access-key <ACCESS_KEY> --secret-key <SECRET_KEY> download <BUCKET_NAME>/<SHARD_NAME>
```

Then, use this script with WebDataset:

```python
import webdataset as wds

# Use the 'pipe:' protocol with your authentication script
dataset = wds.WebDataset("pipe:./auth_script.sh")
```

Ensure that your script has the necessary permissions to be executed and that it correctly handles the authentication and data retrieval process.
