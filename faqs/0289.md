Q: Can WebDataset support interleaved datasets such as MMC4, where one example may include a list of texts with several images?

A: Yes, WebDataset can support interleaved datasets like MMC4. You can organize your dataset by creating a `.json` file that contains the hierarchical structure and references to the image files. This `.json` file acts as a manifest for each sample, detailing the associated text and images. The image files themselves are stored alongside the `.json` file. Here's a simple example of how you might structure a `.json` file for an interleaved dataset:

```json
{
  "text": ["This is the first text", "This is the second text"],
  "images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]
}
```

And in your dataset, you would have the `.json` file and the referenced images in the same sample directory or archive.
