Q: How can I skip a corrupt image sample when using NVIDIA DALI for data loading?

A: When working with NVIDIA DALI for data loading, you can handle corrupt or missing data by using the `handler` parameter. This parameter allows you to specify a behavior when a decoding error occurs. For example, you can use `warn_and_continue` to issue a warning and skip the problematic sample, allowing the data pipeline to continue processing the remaining samples. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where some samples may be corrupt or unreadable.

Here's a short code example demonstrating how to use the `handler` parameter:

```python
from nvidia.dali.plugin import pytorch
import webdataset as wds

def warn_and_continue(e):
    print("Warning: skipping a corrupt sample.", e)

ds = (
    wds.WebDataset(url, handler=warn_and_continue, shardshuffle=True, verbose=verbose)
    .map(_mapper, handler=warn_and_continue)
    .to_tuple("jpg", "cls")
    .map_tuple(transform, identity, handler=warn_and_continue)
    .batched(batch_size)
)
```

By passing `warn_and_continue` to the `.map`, `.map_tuple`, or `.decode` methods, you instruct DALI to handle exceptions gracefully and continue with the next sample.
