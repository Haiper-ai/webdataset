Q: Why does the number of steps per epoch change when increasing `num_workers` in DDP training with Webdataset?

A: When using multiple workers in a distributed data parallel (DDP) training setup with Webdataset, the number of steps per epoch may change if the epoch size is not properly configured to account for the parallelism introduced by the workers. The `with_epoch` method should be applied to the `WebLoader` instead of the `WebDataset` to ensure that the dataset is correctly divided among the workers. Additionally, to maintain proper shuffling across workers, you may need to add cross-worker shuffling. Here's an example of how to configure the loader:

```python
data = wds.WebDataset(self.url, resampled=True).shuffle(1000).map(preprocess_train)
loader = wds.WebLoader(data, pin_memory=True, shuffle=False, batch_size=20, num_workers=2).with_epoch(...)
```

For cross-worker shuffling, you can modify the loader like this:

```python
loader = loader.unbatched().shuffle(2000).batched(20).with_epoch(200)
```
