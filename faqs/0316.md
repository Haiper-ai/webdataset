Q: Why am I getting a ValueError when trying to batch variable-length numpy arrays using webdataset?

A: The error you're encountering is due to the attempt to collate numpy arrays with different shapes into a single batch. Since the `num_frames` dimension varies, you cannot directly convert a list of such arrays into a single numpy array without padding or truncating them to a uniform size. To resolve this, you can specify a custom collation function that handles variable-length sequences appropriately. This function can either pad the sequences to the same length or store them in a data structure that accommodates variable lengths, such as a list or a padded tensor. Here's an example of how to specify a custom collation function:

```python
def custom_collate_fn(batch):
    # Handle variable-length sequences here, e.g., by padding
    # Return the batch in the desired format
    return batch

pipeline.extend([
    # ... other pipeline steps ...
    wds.batched(args.batch_size, collation_fn=custom_collate_fn, partial=not is_train)
])
```

By providing a custom collation function, you can ensure that the data is prepared in a way that is compatible with your model's input requirements.
