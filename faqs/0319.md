Q: How can I handle complex hierarchical data structures in WebDataset?

A: When dealing with complex hierarchical data structures in WebDataset, it's often more practical to use a flat file naming scheme and express the hierarchy within a JSON metadata file. This approach simplifies the file naming while allowing for detailed structuring of the data. You can sequentially number the files and reference them in the JSON, which contains the structure of your dataset, including frame order, timestamps, and other relevant information.

For example, instead of trying to express the hierarchy in the file names, you can name your files like this:

```
sample_0.000.jpg
sample_0.001.jpg
sample_0.002.jpg
sample_0.json
```

And then use a JSON file to define the structure:

```json
{
    "frames": ["000.jpg", "001.jpg", "002.jpg"],
    "timestamps": [10001, 10002, 10003],
    "duration": 3
}
```

This method keeps the file naming simple and leverages the JSON file to maintain the hierarchical relationships within the dataset.
